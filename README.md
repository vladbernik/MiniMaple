## MiniMaple

Write the symbolic diff function

Example:
```
4*x^3, x //=> 12*x^2

4*x^3, y // => 0

4*x^3-x^2, x //=> 12*x^2 - 2*x 
```
Allowed operations are +, -,* and ^.

The program has to handle polynoms, other functions are optional.

Any other operation should lead to an error.

Use TDD!

## UI

Implement minimalistic UI: input field, resulting text and a button to run it.
